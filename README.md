## Resultab.AI 

This is Resultlab.AI's startup project. This project is about that showing the details of the x-ray uploaded by the doctor after it is analyzed with artificial intelligence. Backend of the project, my co-worker and I wrote the necessary codes for this x-ray and the patient to be viewed. 

Firstly I have created the database with pgadmin. Also you can see database diagram in the below. After that we created connection with node.js. Then we managed CRUD operations with RestFull API.
